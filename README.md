Tutorial project for Spark with Java 8. Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. Apache Spark has as its architectural foundation the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way.
